Project Name: Chinese Checkers 

Project Description: The computer version of Chinese Checkers where the player can not only play against 1 or 2 other players but also play against the computer. The computer AI can play up to 2 players at once.

Libraries used: N/A 

Shortcut Commands: In any game mode (whether it is 2 players, 3 players, or AI mode), pressing “e” will take you to the end state of the game where one more move by any player will end the game. Clicking on the settings icon at anytime gives the option of displaying hint, changing background, or returning back to home screen (which essentially re-starts the game).
